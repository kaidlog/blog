Sierra Softworks has a brand new website, rebuilt from the ground up using the
brilliant [Hexo][hexo] project. A lot of emphasis was placed on making it as
easy as possible for us to publish new content here while minimizing the rate
at which content becomes outdated (something our previous website suffered
from rather badly).

As a result, we've tried to move all the project pages to their GitHub repositories
and provide a dynamically generated list of them [here](/projects/). Unfortunately,
not every project we had previously is on GitHub, so we're busy migrating some
of the older content across to this website.

If you can't find one of our older projects here, please
[send us an email](mailto:contact@sierrasoftworks.com).

you can download some of their installers...
