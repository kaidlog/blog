[Traefik][traefik] is an application load balancer written in Go and designed to simplify
the task of serving HTTP(S) services whose configuration changes on the fly. Traefik v1.1.0
was recently released with support for Docker Swarm and it works excellently.

In this post, we'll go through how one sets up their Swarm cluster to automatically expose
its services through Traefik.

<!--more-->

## Why use Traefik?
Unlike traditional reverse proxies, Traefik's configuration is ideally sourced directly
from your service's configuration databases - with support for everything from ZooKeeper
and Consort to Docker Swarm and Kubernetes' metadata. This enables Traefik to react
almost instantaneously to changes in your service configurations, buying back valuable
time on your [SLA budget](https://landing.google.com/sre/interview/ben-treynor.html).

In addition to this: Traefik includes support for HTTP/2.0 out of the box, something I'm
still waiting for HAProxy to support, and [ACME][acme] support (which means LetsEncrypt without
any effort). 

## Setting up your Swarm
First thing's first, we'll need to setup your Docker host to be running in Swarm mode.
This is super-simple to accomplish, simply run the following if you haven't already.

{{< codeblock "Initialize Docker Swarm" >}}
    {{< codeblock-tab powershell >}}
    docker swarm init
    {{< /codeblock-tab >}}
    {{< codeblock-tab bash >}}
    docker swarm init
    {{< /codeblock-tab >}}
{{< /codeblock >}}

At this point, you should be able to run `docker service ls` without any errors.

## Create a Network
You'll also want to create a network on which you'll advertise containers to
Traefik. It's always a good idea to keep services like databases and caches off
of this network, as Traefik will have the ability to access all the containers
on this network, and you don't want to publish your DB by mistake.

{{< codeblock "Create Network" >}}
    {{< codeblock-tab powershell >}}
    docker network create `
        --driver overlay `
        http
    {{< /codeblock-tab >}}
    {{< codeblock-tab bash >}}
    docker network create \
        --driver overlay \
        http
    {{< /codeblock-tab >}}
{{< /codeblock >}}

You'll notice that we're using the `overlay` driver for this network. The overlay
driver will create a virtual network between all of your swarm nodes and make it
available to containers which are connected to this network.

## Create the Traefik Service
Now for the juicy part, we're going to spin up the Traefik container on our Swarm
cluster, giving it access to the `/var/run/docker.sock` socket so that it can access
the Docker API and pull the information it needs to configure itself.

We'll also expose ports `80` and `8080`, the `http` listener and Traefik's web
dashboard respectively.

{{< codeblock "Create Traefik Service" >}}
    {{< codeblock-tab powershell >}}
    docker service create --name traefik `
        --network http `
        -p "80:80" `
        -p "8080:8080" `
        --mount "type=bind,source=/var/run/docker.sock,target=/var/run/docker.sock" `
        "traefik:v1.1.1" `
            --web `
            --docker `
            --docker.swarmmode `
            --docker.watch `
            --docker.domain=localhost
    {{< /codeblock-tab >}}
    {{< codeblock-tab bash >}}
    docker service create --name traefik \
        --network http \
        -p 80:80 \
        -p 8080:8080 \
        --mount "type=bind,source=/var/run/docker.sock,target=/var/run/docker.sock" \
        traefik:v1.1.1 \
            --web \
            --docker \
            --docker.swarmmode \
            --docker.watch \
            --docker.domain=localtest.me
    {{< /codeblock-tab >}}
{{< /codeblock >}}

You'll notice that we're passing a couple of command line options to Traefik here,
specifically the following.

 - `--web` enables Traefik's web control panel (by default on port `8080`).
 - `--docker` enables the Docker configuration driver.
 - `--docker.swarmmode` tells the Docker config driver to use Swarm mode services.
 - `--docker.watch` instructs the Docker driver to watch the Docker event stream for changes.
 - `--docker.domain=localtest.me` tells Traefik to publish services under `<service-name>.localtest.me` vhosts.

## Create your Service
Now you'll want to spin up a container for us to play around with, let's use the
excellent `ehazlett/docker-demo` container, which is perfect for this purpose.

{{< codeblock "Create Demo Service" >}}
    {{< codeblock-tab powershell >}}
    docker service create --name demo `
        --network http `
        --label "traefik.port=8080" `
        ehazlett/docker-demo
    {{< /codeblock-tab >}}
    {{< codeblock-tab bash >}}
    docker service create --name demo \
        --network http \
        --label "traefik.port=8080" \
        ehazlett/docker-demo
    {{< /codeblock-tab >}}
{{< /codeblock >}}

Here we're telling Docker to run the service, connect it to the `http` network and set
the `traefik.port` label, which Traefik will be looking for to determine how to connect
to the container.

## Check Traefik
Now that you've got everything set up, let's hop on over to the Traefik dashboard to
confirm that everything is working correctly.

[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

You should see something like the following:

## Check your Service
Great, now it's time to check that your service is available. We're using
[localtest.me](http://readme.localtest.me) to route requests to your local
machine. All `localtest.me` does is resolve DNS to `127.0.0.1` - nice and
simple.

[http://demo.localtest.me](http://demo.localtest.me)

You should see the demo application, something like this:

## Retrospective
Although this post was somewhat long, there's actually not much going on at all - with all the magic happening
in a total of 4 commands. This just goes to show how easily one can automate the traditionally menial task of
configuring your load balancers.

future posts - please don't hesitate to leave a comment below.
